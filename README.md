# dictionary
Dictionary is used to store the data in a key-value pair format.
it is the data type in Python, which can simulate the real-life data arrangement where some specific value exists for some particular key.
It is the mutable data-structure.
it is defined into element Keys and values.
Keys must be a single element
Value can be any type such as list, tuple, integer, etc.
In other words, we can say that a dictionary is the collection of key-value pairs where the value can be any Python object.
In contrast, the keys are the immutable Python object, i.e., Numbers, string, or tuple.
